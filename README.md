# intrusion-detection-with-IR-sensor-using-ESP32-and-LabVIEW

In this project we have used the ESP32 as the brain of our project which controls all the sensor module and the servo motor attached to it. Furthermore, we have used the Arduino IDE as the programming tool to interface and communicate with the ESP32 to carry out needed operations. Then we used Lab VIEW to present controls from the user and connecting the user to the hardware-based IR sensor through a programming environment.
